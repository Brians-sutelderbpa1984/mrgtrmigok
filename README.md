Omg, you HAVE to tell me what you thought of Cleaner!!! I watched it last night, and I’m still kinda reeling, you know? Like, seriously, I didn’t expect to be that tense. Felt like I was holding my breath the whole time. Samuel L. Jackson doing his thing, man... incredible. But also, how wild is it that he seems to get caught up in sketchy stuff no matter what lol? Maybe it’s time he just chill and sip some iced tea on a porch or something. 😆

> And yoooo, that twist at the end? What was THAT about??? I swear my brain did a backflip trying to piece it together. Sometimes I wonder if they just throw crazy stuff and hope we don’t notice the holes. Anyway, I was too tired to even care last night but like, for real, why doesn’t anyone just download the movie instead of going through all these convoluted plots?? 😂

I mean, Eva Mendes was in there too, kinda underused though, like why cast her if she’s not gonna... you know, Eva Mendes all over the screen??? It’s like hiring a chef and giving them instant noodles, know what I mean? I’m just saying, what a rollercoaster. At one point I was like, “Please, just watch the movie like a normal sane human and enjoy” but nah, I’m over here picking every single thread apart cause that's what I do best apparently.

Anyway omg I really need coffee, I stayed up wayyyy too late thinking about crime scenes. I mean they def. did a good job misleading us, which honestly I appreciate, makes it fun to speculate. But srsly... that final scene? Bro, I was like “Is this genius or did I miss something while I blinked??” 😂

x = Honestly, why did I even write this??

Guess that’s my rant. Hit me up with your thoughts, I wanna know if I missed anything or if we’re on the same page about this insane ride!
